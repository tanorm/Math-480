The following is my answer, below that is the my work on finding the answer. I had it all written out anyways so I decided to include it.

The basis of a prime number is that is has no factors other than one and itself. Therefore if the equation x^2+bx+c
can be factored anything that doesn't work for the factors can be considered a prime number.

Lemma: Let b = y + z and c = yz where y and z are integers.
Then, x^2+bx+c can be factored into (x+y)(x+z).
Since the result will now have a guarenteed 2 factors, the function is composite.

My conjecture is that any values of b and c that can't be expressed as b = y + z and c = yz is prime and since
there are infinitely many combinations of b and c that can't be expressed in this fashion, this is a set
of infinite primes. EDIT: After further study I realized that there were additional conditions in order to make


The following code tests the validity of the Lemma

for x in range(20):
    y = ZZ.random_element(0, 100)
    z = ZZ.random_element(0, 100)
    b = y + z
    c = y*z
    if is_prime(x**2 + b*x + c):
        print "Prime"
    else: print "Not Prime"
