The basis of a prime number is that is has no factors other than one and itself. Therefore if the equation x^2+bx+c
can be factored anything that doesn't work for the factors can be considered a prime number.

Lemma: Let b = y + z and c = yz where y and z are integers.
Then, x^2+bx+c can be factored into (x+y)(x+z).
Since the result will now have a guarenteed 2 factors, the function is composite.

My conjecture is that any values of b and c that can't be expressed as b = y + z and c = yz is prime and since
there are infinitely many combinations of b and c that can't be expressed in this fashion, this is a set
of infinite primes. 

EDIT: After further study I realized that there were additional conditions in order to make
this conjecture correct. The function is also always composite if b is odd and c is even. This can be seen when
x^2 is even, b*x + c will always be even so the function is divisible by 2. When x^2 is odd, b*x will be odd,
so x^2+b*x will be even and therefore the function will be divisible by 2.

So if the original conjecture plus these new conditions are false then it is the set of infinite primes.

The following code tests the validity of the Lemma

for x in range(20):
    y = ZZ.random_element(0, 100)
    z = ZZ.random_element(0, 100)
    b = y + z
    c = y*z
    if is_prime(x**2 + b*x + c):
        print "Prime"
    else: print "Not Prime"
