The following is my answer, below that is the my work on finding the answer. I had it all written out anyways so I decided to include it.

The basis of a prime number is that is has no factors other than one and itself. Therefore if the equation x^2+bx+c
can be factored anything that doesn't work for the factors can be considered a prime number.

Let b = y + z and c = yz where y and z are integers.
Then, x^2+bx+c can be factored into (x+y)(x+z).
Since the result will now have a guarenteed 2 factors, the function is composite.

My conjecture is that any values of b and c that can't be expressed as b = y + z and c = yz is prime and since
there are infinitely many combinations of b and c that can't be expressed in this fashion, this is a set
of infinite primes.
