This function creates a list containing the number of times a value shows up when every
prime number up to 10^7 is modded by n. The number is placed in its corresponding spot on the list.
So the total number of 2's is in [1] of the list.

def mod_n_list(n):
    prime = prime_range(10^7)
    prime_mod = range(len(prime))
    for i in prime_mod:
        prime_mod[i] = prime[i] % n
    if is_prime(n):
        hist = stats.TimeSeries(prime_mod).histogram(n)
    else:
        hist = stats.TimeSeries(prime_mod).histogram(n-1)
    return hist[0]

print mod_n_list(15)

Sidenote: When I was playing around with the TimeSeries object I couldn't quite get it to print out the actual histogram
so I ended up just plugging the values into my calculator. (I was using the sage cell server)

When examining the results for n = 15
[83003, 83108, 1, 83010, 1, 0, 83104, 83152, 0, 0, 83101, 0, 83077, 83022]
it appears that for the values that do appear when the primes are modded by n
have very similar frequencies. The values that appeared once are 3 and 5 which makes sense because
they are factors of 15. The values that didn't appear also have the factors 3 or 5.
My conjecture simply from n = 15 is that there are subsets of the primes which are
sets of primes all with the same remainder. These sets are equivalently distributed throughout the primes
meaning a set with one remainder has almost the same elements as a set with a different remainder.



print mod_n_list(3)
[1, 332194, 332384]
print mod_n_list(12)
[166011, 1, 1, 0, 166169, 0, 166183, 0, 0, 0, 166214]
print mod_n_list(17)
[1, 41498, 41488, 41525, 41561, 41529, 41580, 41557, 41455, 41593, 41531, 41540, 41517, 41511, 41547, 41504, 41642]
print mod_n_list(30)
[83003, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 83104, 0, 0, 0, 83101, 0, 83077, 0, 0, 0, 83107, 0, 83010, 0, 0, 0, 83152, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 83022]

After examining multiple instances of n I believe my original conjecture holds. There are 664579 primes between
0 and 10^7. The primes are evenly distributed in subsets of primes with the same remainder. The exceptions are
remainders that are factors of n (where they have 1) or multiples of those factors (where they have 0).
This implies that in an infinite set of primes modded by n will create even subsets of the primes barring the
excepetions explained above.
